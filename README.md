## What is VetClix?

VetClix is a comprehensive Veterinary Management Software (VMS) suite designed to manage not only animal medical records but also all aspects of animal hospital operations. It includes modules for accounting, tax management, inventory control, customer relationship management (CRM), and human resources (HR).

## History of VetClix

The very first version of VetClix is called `VetHub`, which is developed at 2021 in super urgent for specifically using with Pet Town Animal Hospital to reduce the cost of purchasing VMS software. The `VetHub` was developed using Laravel Lumen (Lightweight Laravel) as its API, and using Next.js to serve its front-end. The infrastructure was using the traditional linux server (Ubuntu) by installing HestiaCP to manage the server. The PostgreSQL database was used as its primary database.

As it was developed in the urgent manner, the code base was super buggy, as well as a bad design, so it is a better choice to develop a whole new application, called VetClix, instead of modifying the existed application.
