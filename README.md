## What is VetClix?

VetClix is a comprehensive Veterinary Management Software (VMS) suite designed to manage not only animal medical records but also all aspects of animal hospital operations. It includes modules for accounting, tax management, inventory control, customer relationship management (CRM), and human resources (HR).

## History of VetClix

The very first version of VetClix was called VetHub, developed back in 2021 under super tight deadlines for exclusive use at Pet Town Animal Hospital. The goal was to cut costs on purchasing VMS software. VetHub was built using Laravel Lumen (a lightweight version of Laravel) for the API, and Next.js for the front end. It ran on a traditional Linux server (Ubuntu) with HestiaCP for server management, and PostgreSQL as the primary database.

Since it was developed in such a rush, the codebase was full of bugs, and the design wasn’t great. So instead of trying to fix it, we decided it was better to build a brand-new application—VetClix.
